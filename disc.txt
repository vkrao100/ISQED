abstract:
1. we are saying given multiple targets - but the targets are chosen heuristically.
2. obviating iterative correction tests individually at multiple nets - not clear - should be - obviating iterative corrections performed individually at multiple nets.

intro:
3. It is ascertained whether the circuit can be rectified at a singel net only.
4. need additional ) after W(X_PI).
5. f_w: F_2^n or (F_2)^n?
6. we can remove 7 as it is integer multiplier specific.
7. allows formulation in a unified framework
