Deciding whether a faulty circuit can be rectified at a given
set of nets to match its intended specification constitutes a 
critical problem in post-verification debugging and rectification.
Contemporary approaches which utilize Boolean SAT and Craig Interpolation techniques
are infeasible in proving the rectifiability of arithmetic circuits.
This paper presents a novel approach using symbolic computer algebra to
prove the rectifiability of a faulty finite field arithmetic circuit
at a given set of $m$ nets. Our approach uses a word-level polynomial 
model and an application of a \Grobner basis decision procedure.
The finite fields corresponding to the datapath
word-length ($n$) and the patch word-length ($m$) may not be compatible.
We make new mathematical and algorithmic contributions which resolve this disparity by 
modeling the problem in an appropriate composite field. 
Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our word-level approach
to ascertain multi-fix rectifiability compared to contemporary approaches.
