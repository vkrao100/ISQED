\begin{abstract}
Deciding whether a faulty circuit can be rectified at a given
set of nets to match its intended specification constitutes a 
critical problem in post-verification debugging and rectification.
Contemporary approaches which utilize Boolean SAT and Craig Interpolation techniques
are infeasible in proving the rectifiability of arithmetic circuits.
This paper presents a novel approach using symbolic computer algebra to
prove the rectifiability of a faulty finite field arithmetic circuit
at a given set of $m$ nets. Our approach uses a word-level polynomial 
model and an application of a \Grobner basis decision procedure.
The finite fields corresponding to the datapath
word-length ($n$) and the patch word-length ($m$) may not be compatible.
We make new mathematical and algorithmic contributions which resolve this disparity by 
modeling the problem in an appropriate composite field. 
Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our word-level approach
to ascertain multi-fix rectifiability compared to contemporary approaches.

%% Rectification of buggy circuits involves identifying a
%% subset of nets where the circuit can be corrected, 
%% and to subsequently compute rectification functions at these target
%% nets to patch the circuit. Often, bugs have to be patched at
%% multiple nets, a process termed as multi-fix rectification. 
%% Contemporary Boolean SAT and Craig interpolation based approaches
%% iteratively and incrementally compute rectification patches at
%% individual targets that partially fix the circuit in each iteration 
%% -- this is infeasible for arithmetic circuits. This paper presents a
%% novel approach using symbolic computer algebra that rectifies 
%% a buggy finite field arithmetic circuit, simultaneously, at 
%% multiple targets. Using a (word-level) polynomial model, our approach
%% employs \Grobner basis computations over finite fields, to ascertain
%% if the circuit can be rectified at multiple-targets, and computes
%% rectification functions at bit-vector level. Our approach also
%% computes observability don't care conditions for the multi-fix patch
%% at the word-level, using which rectification functions at individual
%% nets are easily synthesized.  Experiments conducted over various
%% finite field arithmetic circuits demonstrate the efficacy of our
%% approach.
